We have used results from such studies as the basis for our estimates instead of results from studies that focus on acute particle exposures. Regarding morbidity, health effects were evaluated for the following: respiratory hospital admissions, asthma related emergency room (ER) visits, minor restricted activity days (MRAD) and work loss days (WLD). Other health and welfare benefits were excluded due to the inability to appropriately monetize them and to avoid double counting. To estimate the economic value of reductions in air
pollution-related premature mortality, we have used a
methodology referred to as the ‘‘value of statistical lifeyears’’ or VSLY [37]. In this approach, age-specific life
expectancy and death rates are taken into account together
with the age distribution and size of the exposed population to estimate the average number of years of life lost
(YLL) per death. YLL per death was calculated from the
WHO World Health Report 2002 [5] for the AMR-A subregion, which includes Canada, United States and Cuba.

6 224 000 students (in 303 400 classrooms in 9900
schools in 2009–2010) (California Department of Education, 2012b), an increase in mean VRs from 4 to

school districts, under current formulas, by $33 million
(Table 5). Among this population, an increase in VR
from 4 to 7.1 l/s-person would also produce benefits
for families, from decreased costs for caregiver time,
amounting to $80 million",Increating VR from the California average (4 l/s/person) ot the State standard of 7.1 l/s/ person,,,,increase costs by $4 million annually,,33 M,increased state revenue to school districts (3.4% less illness absense),80 M,reduced cargiving by families,Increating VR from the California average (4 l/s/person) to 9.4 l/s/ person,,7.3 M,electricity and gas costs,66 M,increased state revenue to school districts due to less ilness absense,160 M ,reduced caregiving by families,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
